		<h3>Jordan Potter - CEO and Brand Ambassador</h3>
		
		<p>The dreamer who dared to dream the impossible true story that is Pizzarithmetic.com. He came up with the idea and also the name and also asked David to make the site.</p>

		<p>When he's not in the lab further perfecting his secret pizza algorithm, Jordan also co-writes the world's <a href="https://twitter.com/XFilesbutemoji" alt="Mulder and Scully" title="Mulder and Scully">#1 X-Files as emoji twitter account</a> and does standup comedy under the pseudonyms "Chris Rock" and "Jordan Potter".</p>

		<h3>David Proctor - CTO and Hand Model</h3>
		
		<p>Made this site and knows Jordan in real life. He did not spend eight years getting a Ph.D in visual design to be called "Mister Proctor."</p>
